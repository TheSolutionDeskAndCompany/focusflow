git@github.com:the-solution-desk/focusflow.git

  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build"
  }
}
🏗️ Phase 1 — Project Setup on Replit
Import from GitHub

In Replit, click “Import from GitHub” → paste
git@github.com:the-solution-desk/focusflow.git

Select main branch.

Add .replit file
Create a file named .replit in the root with:

ini
Copy
Edit
run = "npm install && npm start"
language = "nodejs"
Install dependencies
In the Replit shell:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Verify startup

Click Run → React boilerplate should appear at /

Visit /app → you should see the GoalInput component.

Commit initial state

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Replit: initial import and setup"
git push origin main
🚀 Phase 2 — Core Features & Feedback Loop
1. Landing Page (LandingPage.js)
Hero section, features, CTA → use Tailwind via CDN or local.

2. Define Goal (GoalInput.js)
Already implemented: “What challenge are you solving?”

3. Employee Satisfaction Survey
Why: Customer satisfaction rises when employees find tools friction‑free.

After each major action, show a one‑question widget:

arduino
Copy
Edit
“How easy was that last step?”  
 1 😫 2 😕 3 😐 4 🙂 5 😃
Persist scores to backend → display rolling average on Dashboard.

4. Dashboard
Show process KPIs and average “ease‑of‑use” scores side by side.

✅ Phase 3 — Testing & Deployment
Branch per feature

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature/employee-survey
Develop & test in Replit (auto‑reload preview).

Commit & open PR → merge to main.

Deploy

Replit auto‑deploys the live URL on each push.

(Optional) Map to your custom domain.
