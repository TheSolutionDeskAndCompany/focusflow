“Get Started” → /signup

Secondary CTA (text link):
“See Features” → /features

One‑click switch between Login ↔ Signup

Security reassurance: “Your data is safe & private.”

🔗 Navigation & Flow
Keep landing at /—no heavy scrolling.

Use prominent CTAs in hero & teasers to drive clicks to deeper pages.

Sticky header ensures users can jump anywhere without scrolling back up.

Micro‑animations (hover, icon transitions) draw the eye without adding length.

This structure ensures your first page is all‑in‑one “elevator pitch”—compact, visually engaging, and primed to send visitors to the next logical step.
